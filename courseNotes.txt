Negatives
-All CSS in a single file, instead of using css modules 
-Relies on binding methods in a class component state instead of using methods based on arrow functions for which the correct this binding is done implicitely
-several components in a single file do not look like an approach that improves orientation 


Positives

-explains {children} really well
-explains well PropTypes validations
-default prop values
-component reusability
-React Context
